## 🔄 **Key Configuration Changes**

### **Tool Output Protocol Centralization**

**Before**: Duplicate instructions in every agent
```yaml
# Repeated across 4+ agents
instructions: |
  🚨 CRITICAL: TOOL OUTPUT DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS 🚨
  1. ✅ Display the COMPLETE tool output EXACTLY as received
  2. ✅ Include ALL content between the 🚨 markers
  [... 15+ lines repeated in each agent]
```

**After**: Centralized protocol with agent-specific focus
```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  🚨 UNIVERSAL TOOL OUTPUT PROTOCOL 🚨
  [Centralized rules apply to all agents]

agents:
  - instructions: |
      🔬 Research Specialist focused on comprehensive analysis.
      PROTOCOL: [Reference to centralized protocol]
      [Agent-specific guidance only]
```

### **Agent Specialization Enhancement**

**Before**: Generic agents with broad, unfocused instructions
**After**: Specialized agents with clear roles and capabilities

```yaml
# NEW: Task Planner - Project management focus
- name: "Task Planner"
  tools: ["start_task_planning", "resume_workflow", "research_quick"]
  instructions: |
    📋 Project planner combining research with task breakdown.
    CAPABILITIES: Task decomposition, timeline planning, resource allocation.

# NEW: Document Analyst - Document processing focus  
- name: "Document Analyst"
  tools: ["start_document_review", "resume_workflow", "research_quick"]
  instructions: |
    📄 Document analyst providing comprehensive review.
    CAPABILITIES: Content analysis, accuracy verification, insight extraction.
```
